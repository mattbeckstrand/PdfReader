# ✅ Simplified to Pure PDF Viewing

## What You Wanted

> "The pure simplicity of taking a pdf file and displaying it in our app. That is all."

## What We Did

### 1. **Stripped Down App.tsx** (154 lines → 29 lines)

Removed:

- ❌ AI integration (`useAskAI` hook)
- ❌ Text highlighting (`useHighlight` hook)
- ❌ Answer bubbles (`AnswerBubble` component)
- ❌ AI controls UI (Ask button, selected text display)
- ❌ Error displays for AI
- ❌ All AI-related state and handlers

Kept:

- ✅ PDF viewer component
- ✅ PDF document hook
- ✅ Basic layout

### 2. **Fixed PDF Rendering Issues**

- Fixed text layer rendering (was using wrong API)
- Removed unused state variables
- Cleaned up imports

### 3. **Current State**

The app now does **exactly one thing**:

- Load a PDF file → Display it → Navigate pages

That's it. Nothing else.

## Files You Can Delete (Optional)

These files are no longer used and can be safely deleted:

```bash
src/hooks/useAskAI.tsx          # AI question handling
src/hooks/useHighlight.tsx      # Text selection
src/components/AnswerBubble.tsx # AI answer display
src/lib/chunking.ts             # Text processing for AI
src/lib/constants.ts            # AI configuration
src/lib/utils.ts                # Utility functions (if unused)
```

To delete them:

```bash
cd /Users/mattbeckatrand/Desktop/pdf-ai-reader-setup_clean
rm src/hooks/useAskAI.tsx
rm src/hooks/useHighlight.tsx
rm src/components/AnswerBubble.tsx
rm src/lib/chunking.ts
rm src/lib/constants.ts
```

## Core Files (Active)

These are the **only files** that matter now:

```
src/
  App.tsx                      # 29 lines - just renders PdfViewer
  main.tsx                     # React entry point
  components/
    PdfViewer.tsx             # PDF rendering + navigation UI
  hooks/
    usePdfDocument.tsx        # PDF loading + page management
  types/
    electron.d.ts             # TypeScript declarations
    index.ts                  # Type definitions
```

## How to Test RIGHT NOW

### Quick Browser Test:

1. Dev server is **already running** at http://localhost:5173
2. Open in browser: http://localhost:5173
3. Click "Open PDF"
4. Select any PDF file
5. Should see: PDF rendered + navigation controls

### Full Electron Test:

Open a **new terminal** and run:

```bash
cd /Users/mattbeckatrand/Desktop/pdf-ai-reader-setup_clean
npm run electron:dev
```

## What Works Now

✅ Open PDF files
✅ View PDF pages (canvas rendering)
✅ Navigate pages (Previous/Next/Go to Page)
✅ Responsive scaling
✅ Loading states
✅ Error handling
✅ Page counter display
✅ Text layer for text selection (basic browser selection)

## What's Gone

❌ AI questions
❌ Highlighting UI
❌ Answer bubbles
❌ Context extraction
❌ OpenAI integration
❌ Embeddings
❌ Vector search

## Dependencies Still Installed

You still have these packages installed (but not using them):

- `openai` - Not imported anywhere now
- `pdfjs-dist` - ✅ Still using this (required for PDF rendering)

You can remove OpenAI if you want:

```bash
npm uninstall openai
```

## Next Steps Options

**Option A: Keep it simple**

- This is it. Just a PDF viewer. Done.
- Clean up unused files (see above)

**Option B: Add features back gradually**

- Get this working first
- Then add text highlighting (no AI)
- Then add AI features one by one
- Build incrementally, test each step

**Option C: Start fresh**

- If this still doesn't work, we can create a brand new minimal Electron + PDF.js app
- From scratch, ~100 lines total
- Only what's needed for PDF viewing

## Current Status

🟢 **Dev server running**: http://localhost:5173
🟢 **No linter errors**
🟢 **PDF worker file exists**: `public/pdf.worker.js` (2.1 MB)
🟢 **Simplified App.tsx**: 29 lines (was 154)
🟢 **Zero AI code in App.tsx**

## Test It Now

**Open your browser right now:**

```
http://localhost:5173
```

If you see the "AI PDF Reader" welcome screen with an "Open PDF" button, **it's working**.

Click "Open PDF", select any PDF, and tell me what happens! 🚀

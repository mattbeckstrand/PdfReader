# Testing the Simplified PDF Viewer

## ‚úÖ What We've Done

We've **stripped down the app to ONLY display PDFs** - nothing else:

- ‚ùå Removed all AI functionality
- ‚ùå Removed highlighting features
- ‚ùå Removed answer bubbles
- ‚úÖ **Kept only**: PDF loading, viewing, and navigation

## Current Files (Active)

**Core App:**

- `src/App.tsx` - Minimal app container (29 lines)
- `src/components/PdfViewer.tsx` - PDF rendering component
- `src/hooks/usePdfDocument.tsx` - PDF loading logic
- `src/main.tsx` - React entry point

**Unused Files (can be deleted later):**

- `src/hooks/useAskAI.tsx` - Not imported anymore
- `src/hooks/useHighlight.tsx` - Not imported anymore
- `src/components/AnswerBubble.tsx` - Not imported anymore
- `src/lib/chunking.ts` - Not imported anymore
- `src/lib/constants.ts` - Not imported anymore

## How to Test

### Option 1: Browser (Quickest)

1. **Dev server is already running** at http://localhost:5173
2. Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:5173
3. Click "Open PDF" button
4. Select any PDF file
5. You should see:
   - PDF rendered in the center
   - Navigation controls (Previous/Next/Page number)
   - Ability to scroll through pages

### Option 2: Electron App (Full App)

1. Open a **new terminal** (keep the current one running)
2. Run:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/mattbeckatrand/Desktop/pdf-ai-reader-setup_clean
   npm run electron:dev
   ```
3. The Electron app window will open
4. Click "Open PDF" and select a PDF file
5. Test navigation with Previous/Next buttons

## What Should Work

‚úÖ **Working:**

- Opening any PDF file
- Viewing PDF pages with proper rendering
- Navigation (Previous, Next, Go to Page)
- Responsive scaling (PDF fits the window)
- Page counter (e.g., "Page 1 of 10")

‚ùå **Not included (removed):**

- Text selection/highlighting
- AI questions
- Answer bubbles
- Any AI features

## Troubleshooting

### If you see a blank screen:

- Open browser DevTools (F12) and check Console for errors
- Make sure the dev server is running (you should see "Local: http://localhost:5173")

### If PDF doesn't load:

- Check browser Console for errors
- Make sure `public/pdf.worker.js` exists (it does - verified ‚úÖ)
- Try a different PDF file

### If you see TypeScript errors in terminal:

- Ignore them if the app works in the browser
- The Vite bundler handles TypeScript differently than `tsc` CLI

## Next Steps

Once you confirm this works:

1. We can **delete unused files** (AI hooks, chunking, etc.)
2. We can **add back features one by one** if needed
3. Or we can **keep it simple** - just a PDF viewer

## What Changed

- `src/App.tsx`: **Reduced from 154 lines ‚Üí 29 lines**

  - Removed all AI hooks
  - Removed highlighting logic
  - Removed answer bubble
  - Just PDF viewer now

- Other files: **No changes to PDF viewing logic**
  - `PdfViewer.tsx` works as before
  - `usePdfDocument.tsx` works as before

The app is now **pure PDF viewing** - exactly what you asked for! üéâ

# üé® High-DPI (Retina Display) Fix

## The Problem

PDFs looked **grainy and blurry** on Mac Retina displays (and other high-DPI screens).

### Why It Happened

Your Mac has a **2x Retina display** (`devicePixelRatio = 2`):

- **1 CSS pixel** = **2 physical pixels** on your screen
- Canvas was rendering at **1x resolution** (800√ó1000 pixels)
- Browser stretched it to **2x** (1600√ó2000 physical pixels)
- Result: **Blurry, pixelated PDF** üòû

## The Fix

### Before (Grainy)

```typescript
// ‚ùå Only rendered at logical pixel resolution
canvas.width = scaledViewport.width; // 800 pixels
canvas.height = scaledViewport.height; // 1000 pixels
canvas.style.width = `${scaledViewport.width}px`;
canvas.style.height = `${scaledViewport.height}px`;
```

### After (Crystal Clear) ‚ú®

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Renders at physical pixel resolution
const dpr = window.devicePixelRatio || 1; // 2 on Retina

// Internal canvas resolution: 2x for sharp rendering
canvas.width = scaledViewport.width * dpr; // 800 * 2 = 1600 pixels
canvas.height = scaledViewport.height * dpr; // 1000 * 2 = 2000 pixels

// CSS size: same visual size, but sharper
canvas.style.width = `${scaledViewport.width}px`; // Still 800px
canvas.style.height = `${scaledViewport.height}px`; // Still 1000px

// Scale the rendering context to match
context.setTransform(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0); // Reset to prevent compounding
context.scale(dpr, dpr);

// Enable high-quality rendering
context.imageSmoothingEnabled = true;
context.imageSmoothingQuality = 'high';
```

## What Changed

### File: `src/components/PdfViewer.tsx`

**Lines 121-150** - Added high-DPI support:

1. **Detect device pixel ratio** (`window.devicePixelRatio`)
2. **Multiply canvas dimensions** by DPR for internal resolution
3. **Keep CSS size** at logical pixels (same visual size)
4. **Reset transform** before scaling (prevents compounding on re-renders)
5. **Scale context** by DPR for proper rendering
6. **Enable high-quality smoothing** for images

## Results

### Before

- Canvas internal: **800√ó1000 pixels**
- Physical screen: **1600√ó2000 pixels**
- Browser upscales: **Blurry** ‚ùå

### After

- Canvas internal: **1600√ó2000 pixels** (matches screen)
- Physical screen: **1600√ó2000 pixels**
- No upscaling needed: **Crystal clear** ‚úÖ

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Sharp text** - Crisp, readable text at any zoom level
‚úÖ **Clear graphics** - Vector graphics render cleanly
‚úÖ **Better images** - PDF images display at full quality
‚úÖ **Professional look** - No more pixelated/grainy appearance
‚úÖ **Works on all displays** - Automatically adapts to any DPR (1x, 2x, 3x)

## Testing

Reload your browser and compare:

**Before:** Text looked fuzzy, lines were jagged
**After:** Text is sharp, lines are smooth

Try these to verify:

- Zoom in on text - should stay crisp
- Look at diagrams/graphics - should have clean edges
- Compare to a native PDF viewer - should look similar quality

## Technical Details

### Why Reset Transform?

```typescript
context.setTransform(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0); // Reset to identity
```

Without this, on re-renders (like window resize), the scale would compound:

- First render: 2x
- Second render: 2x √ó 2x = 4x
- Third render: 4x √ó 2x = 8x
- PDF becomes huge and breaks!

### Why Same CSS Size?

```typescript
canvas.width = 1600; // Internal resolution: high
canvas.style.width = '800px'; // Display size: same
```

This is the key trick:

- **Internal resolution** is high (sharp pixels)
- **Display size** stays same (doesn't take up more screen space)
- Browser doesn't need to scale (1:1 mapping to physical pixels)

### Browser Support

This technique works in **all modern browsers**:

- ‚úÖ Chrome/Edge (Chromium)
- ‚úÖ Firefox
- ‚úÖ Safari
- ‚úÖ Electron (what we're using)

`devicePixelRatio` has been supported since:

- Chrome 1+ (2008)
- Firefox 18+ (2013)
- Safari 3+ (2007)

## Comparison

### Standard 1x Display

- DPR = 1
- Canvas: 800√ó1000 pixels
- Result: Already looked fine

### Retina 2x Display (Your Mac)

- DPR = 2
- Canvas: 1600√ó2000 pixels
- Result: **Now looks sharp!** üéâ

### Super Retina 3x Display (Some devices)

- DPR = 3
- Canvas: 2400√ó3000 pixels
- Result: Even sharper (automatically handled)

## Performance

**Q: Does 2x resolution use 4x memory/CPU?**
A: Yes, but:

- Modern devices can handle it (designed for high-DPI)
- You're already displaying at that resolution (screen has those pixels)
- Without this, you're wasting screen quality
- PDF.js is optimized for this use case

**Q: Will it slow down?**
A: Negligible - your GPU handles this efficiently. The quality improvement is worth it.

**Now refresh your browser and enjoy crisp, beautiful PDFs!** ‚ú®

Your PDF should look as sharp as a native PDF viewer now.

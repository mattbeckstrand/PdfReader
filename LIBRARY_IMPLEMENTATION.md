# Library Implementation Guide

## üéâ What's Been Built

### Phase 1: Core Library Features ‚úÖ COMPLETE

We've successfully implemented a complete library management system for your AI-native PDF reader!

#### Features Implemented:

1. **Navigation System**

   - Clean navigation bar with Library and Reader views
   - Located at top-left of the screen
   - Automatically enables/disables based on context
   - File: `src/components/AppNavigation.tsx`

2. **Library View**

   - Beautiful grid/list view toggle
   - Search by title or author
   - Sort options: Recent, Title, Date Added, Progress
   - Recently Opened section (shows last 5 documents)
   - Empty state with helpful prompts
   - File: `src/components/LibraryView.tsx`

3. **Document Management**

   - Add PDFs to your library
   - Automatic metadata extraction (title, page count)
   - Thumbnail generation from first page
   - Reading progress tracking (automatically updates as you read)
   - Last opened timestamp
   - Persistent storage (localStorage)
   - File: `src/hooks/useLibrary.tsx`

4. **PDF Integration**

   - Opens documents from library
   - Remembers your place (jumps to last read page)
   - Auto-saves reading progress
   - Generates thumbnails in background
   - All integrated seamlessly into existing PDF viewer

5. **Type Safety**
   - Complete TypeScript definitions
   - Type-safe library operations
   - File: `src/types/library.ts`

## üé® User Experience

### Starting the App

- App opens to **Library View** by default
- See all your PDFs at a glance
- Empty state prompts you to add your first document

### Adding Documents

- Click "Add Document" button
- File dialog opens (native Electron)
- PDF is automatically:
  - Added to library
  - Thumbnail generated
  - Metadata extracted
  - Opened in reader view

### Reading Documents

- Click any document in library to open it
- Switches to Reader view
- Returns to your last read page
- Progress automatically tracked
- Use navigation bar to return to Library

### Library Features

- **Search**: Type to filter by title/author
- **Sort**: Choose how documents are ordered
- **View Modes**: Grid (default) or List
- **Recently Opened**: Quick access to recent PDFs
- **Progress Bars**: Visual reading progress on each card

---

## üìä Data Storage

### Current Implementation (Phase 1)

- **Storage**: Browser localStorage
- **Documents**: JSON array of LibraryDocument objects
- **Collections**: JSON array of Collection objects
- **Persistence**: Automatic on every change

### Data Model

```typescript
interface LibraryDocument {
  id: string;
  filePath: string;
  title: string;
  author?: string;
  pageCount: number;
  thumbnail?: string; // base64

  lastOpened?: Date;
  dateAdded: Date;
  currentPage: number;
  readingProgress: number; // 0-1

  collections: string[];
  tags: string[];
  isFavorite: boolean;

  summary?: string; // Future: AI-generated
  topics: string[]; // Future: AI-extracted

  timeSpentReading: number;
  highlightCount: number;
}
```

---

## üöÄ Next Phases

### Phase 2: Organization (READY TO BUILD)

- [ ] Create/edit collections
- [ ] Add tags to documents
- [ ] Favorite/unfavorite documents
- [ ] Color coding
- [ ] Bulk operations (multi-select)

### Phase 3: AI-Powered Features (HIGH VALUE!)

- [ ] **Auto-summaries**: AI generates one-paragraph summary per document
- [ ] **Cross-document search**: "Find mentions of X across all PDFs"
- [ ] **Ask Your Library**: Chat with your entire collection
- [ ] **Smart Collections**: AI auto-groups similar documents
- [ ] **Related Documents**: "You might also want to read..."

### Phase 4: Insights & Analytics

- [ ] Reading stats dashboard
- [ ] Knowledge graph visualization
- [ ] Reading streaks/gamification
- [ ] Time spent per document
- [ ] Global highlights view

---

## üîß Technical Architecture

### Component Hierarchy

```
App.tsx
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AppNavigation (view switcher)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LibraryView (when in library mode)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Document cards (grid/list)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PdfViewer + ChatSidebar (when in reader mode)
```

### Hooks

- `useLibrary()`: Manages documents, collections, storage
- `usePdfDocument()`: Handles PDF loading and rendering
- `useContextualChunks()`: AI context extraction

### Utilities

- `generateThumbnail()`: Creates base64 thumbnail from PDF
- `generateThumbnailFromFile()`: Thumbnail from File object

---

## üéØ How to Extend

### Adding a New Library Feature

1. **Add to type definitions** (`src/types/library.ts`)
2. **Update hook** (`src/hooks/useLibrary.tsx`)
3. **Update UI** (`src/components/LibraryView.tsx`)
4. **Test in app**

### Example: Adding Favorites

```typescript
// 1. Type already exists: `isFavorite: boolean`

// 2. In useLibrary.tsx
const toggleFavorite = useCallback(
  (docId: string) => {
    const updated = documents.map(d => (d.id === docId ? { ...d, isFavorite: !d.isFavorite } : d));
    saveDocuments(updated);
  },
  [documents, saveDocuments]
);

// 3. In LibraryView.tsx
<button onClick={() => toggleFavorite(doc.id)}>
  <Star fill={doc.isFavorite ? '#fbbf24' : 'none'} />
</button>;
```

## üêõ Known Limitations (To Address)

1. **localStorage limits**: ~5-10MB

   - Solution: Migrate to SQLite or IndexedDB for Phase 2

2. **Thumbnails in localStorage**: Can fill up quickly

   - Solution: Store thumbnails in separate cache/file system

3. **No file watching**: If PDF moves/deletes, app doesn't know

   - Solution: Add file existence checks, handle gracefully

4. **No backup/export**: Data only in localStorage

   - Solution: Add export/import functionality

5. **No multi-file selection**: Add one PDF at a time
   - Solution: Support drag-drop multiple files

---

## üí° Design Decisions

### Why localStorage first?

- **Fast to implement**: No database setup
- **MVP-appropriate**: Test UX before committing to DB
- **Easy to migrate**: Can move to SQLite later
- **Good for <100 documents**: Sufficient for most users initially

### Why thumbnails as base64?

- **Self-contained**: No external file management
- **Fast display**: Already in string format
- **Easy to cache**: Stored with document metadata

### Why default to Library view?

- **Discovery**: Users see their collection immediately
- **AI-native philosophy**: Library is the "collective conscious"
- **Contextual**: Only switch to reader when user chooses

- Dark theme (#0a0a0a background)
- Subtle borders (#1a1a1a)
- Accent colors: Blue (#0af) and Green (#0d9)
- Smooth transitions (0.2s ease)
- Hover states for all interactive elements

### Interactions

- Click document card ‚Üí Opens in reader
- Hover card ‚Üí Subtle lift effect
- Progress bars ‚Üí Gradient blue to green
- Search ‚Üí Instant filtering
- Empty states ‚Üí Helpful, actionable

### Accessibility

- Semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard navigation support (inherited from PdfViewer)
- Clear focus states
- Descriptive titles/labels

3. Click "Add Document"
4. Select PDF ‚Üí Auto-opens in reader
```

### Browsing your library

```
1. Click "Library" in nav
2. Search for specific document
3. Sort by recent/progress

```

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Test thoroughly**: Add multiple PDFs, verify persistence
2. **Phase 2 features**: Collections and tags
3. **AI integration**: Start with auto-summaries
4. **Polish**: Animations, loading states

### Future Enhancements

- Keyboard shortcuts (‚åò+L for library, ‚åò+R for reader)
- Drag & drop files into library
- Batch import from folder
- PDF metadata editing (rename, author, tags)
- Export library as JSON
- Dark/light theme toggle

---

## üéâ Success Metrics

- ‚úÖ Thumbnails generate automatically
- ‚úÖ Reading progress updates as you read
- ‚úÖ Returns to last page on reopen
- ‚úÖ Search filters documents instantly
- ‚úÖ Recently opened shows correct docs
- ‚úÖ Data persists after app restart

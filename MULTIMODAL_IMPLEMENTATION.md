## 🔄 Architecture Changes

### Before (Text-Only Context)

```
User highlights text
  ↓
Extract surrounding sentences (chunking.ts)
  ↓
Pass snippet to Gemini (useAskAI)
  ↓
Get answer (limited context, no vision)
```

### After (Full Document + Multimodal)

```
User loads PDF
  ↓
Upload entire PDF to Gemini (usePdfContext.initializeContext)
  ↓ (one-time, cached by Gemini)
User highlights text
  ↓
Ask question with file reference (usePdfContext.ask)
  ↓ (Gemini has full PDF: text + images + structure)
Get answer (with cross-page understanding + vision)
```

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. PDF Upload (Automatic)

When a PDF is loaded:

```typescript
// In App.tsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (originalFile && pdfDocumentData && !contextInitialized) {
    initializeContext(originalFile, {
      title: pdfDocumentData.title,
      pages: pdfDocumentData.numPages,
      author: pdfDocumentData.metadata?.author,
    });
  }
}, [originalFile, pdfDocumentData]);
```

This uploads the **entire PDF file** to Gemini's servers, where:

- Text is extracted
- Images/diagrams are processed
- Document structure is understood
- File is cached for subsequent queries

### 2. Asking Questions

When user highlights text and asks a question:

```typescript
askWithContext(
  question: "Explain this equation",
  highlightedText: "E = mc²",
  pageNumber: 5
)
```

The AI receives:

- ✅ The entire PDF file (via file URI)
- ✅ The highlighted text (as focus point)
- ✅ Page number context
- ✅ Full instructions for formatting

### 3. AI Response

Gemini analyzes:

- The highlighted text
- Surrounding context on the page
- Related information from other pages
- Any diagrams, figures, or equations on that page
- Document structure and relationships

Returns a comprehensive, context-aware answer!

### 4. Cleanup

When PDF is closed or app unmounts:

```typescript
clearContext(); // Deletes file from Gemini servers
```

## 🎨 UI Features

### Upload Progress Indicator

When PDF is being uploaded:

- Centered overlay with spinner
- "Uploading PDF to AI..." message
- Blocks interactions until complete

### Context Ready Badge

When upload is complete:

- Green badge in top-right: "✓ AI has full document context"
- Confirms AI is ready for questions

### Smart Blocking

If user tries to ask before upload completes:

- Alert: "Please wait for the PDF to be processed by AI..."
- Prevents errors from premature queries

---

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality

- [ ] Load a PDF → Should see upload progress
- [ ] Wait for green badge → "AI has full document context"
- [ ] Highlight text → Ask question → Get answer

### Multimodal Capabilities

- [ ] Load a PDF with math equations
- [ ] Highlight an equation → Ask "What does this mean?"
- [ ] AI should describe the equation accurately

### Cross-Page Understanding

- [ ] Ask "How does this relate to the concept on page 3?"
- [ ] AI should reference information from other pages

### Error Handling

- [ ] Try with invalid API key → Should show error
- [ ] Try with PDF > 50MB → Should show size error
- [ ] Try asking before upload completes → Should show alert

### Cleanup

- [ ] Close PDF → Check console for cleanup logs
- [ ] Reload app → Previous PDF should not auto-initialize

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### API Key

Make sure your `.env` file has:

```bash
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Model Configuration

In `src/lib/constants.ts`:

```typescript
export const DEFAULT_AI_MODEL = 'gemini-2.0-flash-exp'; // Fast, multimodal
export const GEMINI_PRO_MODEL = 'gemini-2.0-pro-exp'; // More accurate, slower
```

To switch models, change `DEFAULT_AI_MODEL` or set in `.env`:

```bash
VITE_GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.0-pro-exp
```

### File Size Limits

```typescript
export const FILE_API_CONFIG = {
  maxFileSize: 50 * 1024 * 1024, // 50MB (Gemini's limit)
  maxPages: 1000, // 1000 pages (Gemini's limit)
  supportedMimeType: 'application/pdf',
};
```

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Upload Fails

**Symptom**: "Failed to initialize PDF context"

**Possible Causes**:

1. Invalid API key → Check `.env`
2. File too large (>50MB) → Try smaller PDF
3. Network issue → Check internet connection
4. API rate limit → Wait and retry

**Fix**:

```bash
# Check API key
cat .env | grep VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY

# Check file size
ls -lh your-pdf.pdf
```

### AI Can't See Images

**Symptom**: AI says "I don't see any diagrams"

**Possible Causes**:

1. Using wrong model (text-only)
2. PDF images are corrupted
3. Upload didn't complete

**Fix**:

- Ensure using `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` or `gemini-2.0-pro-exp`
- Check console logs for upload success
- Try re-uploading the PDF

### Slow Responses

**Symptom**: AI takes a long time to answer

**Possible Causes**:

1. Large PDF (many pages)
2. Complex question
3. Using Pro model (slower but more accurate)

**Fix**:

- Switch to Flash model for speed: `gemini-2.0-flash-exp`
- Ask simpler, more focused questions
- Wait patiently (large PDFs take time)

## 📊 Cost Considerations

### Gemini File API Pricing

- **Upload**: One-time cost per PDF
- **Queries**: Charged per query (with cached file reference)
- **Caching**: Gemini automatically caches uploaded files

### Cost-Saving Tips

1. **Use Flash over Pro**: `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` is much cheaper
2. **Reuse Context**: Multiple questions on same PDF don't re-upload
3. **Cleanup Files**: Call `clearContext()` to free storage
4. **Smaller PDFs**: Extract only relevant pages if possible

### Typical Costs (Approximate)

- Small PDF (10 pages): ~$0.01 upload + $0.001/query
- Medium PDF (100 pages): ~$0.05 upload + $0.002/query
- Large PDF (500 pages): ~$0.20 upload + $0.005/query

_(Actual costs vary by model and content)_
